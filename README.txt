SERVICES
    Teaching Assistant of Computer Network Principles (2020 Fall, undergraduates' major course)
        Supervised 18 outstanding students to finish the challenging hardware IPv4 router project.
        The project includes a homemade RISC-V processor with RV32I support and a forwarding engine with four one-gigabit ports wire-speed forwarding capability.  They achieved forwarding tables sized 8000+ IPv4 prefixes on average.
    Teaching Assistant of Computer Network Principles (2021 Fall, undergraduates' major course)
        Supervised 6 outstanding students to finish the challenging hardware IPv6 router project.
        The project includes a homemade RISC-V processor with RV32I support and a forwarding engine with four one-gigabit ports wire-speed forwarding capability.  The best group achieved forwarding tables sized 8000+ IPv6 prefixes.
    Teaching Assistant of Computer Network Principles (2022 Fall, undergraduates' major course)
